**SideQuest** is an interactive storytelling platform where kids co-create stories with AI — writing new lines, visualizing them with generated images, and branching their stories into infinite creative paths.  
Built with a **Django backend**, **React frontend**, a **PostgreSQL database** for story storage and branching, and powered by the **Google Gemini API** for text and image generation.

## 📌 Features

- **Interactive Story Creation**
  - Kids receive an AI-generated prompt or start their own story.
  - Each time they add to the story, the AI continues it and generates a matching image.
  - At the end, all story frames are compiled into a **digital comic book**.

- **Library & Story Management**
  - Stores all the user’s stories in a personal library.
  - Stories can be revisited, viewed, and expanded later.

- **Branching SideQuests**
  - Users can select any story cell and **branch** from that point, creating alternate storylines.
  - Each branch copies the existing story and adds new AI-generated continuations.
  - Encourages imagination and storytelling depth.

- **AI Image & Text Generation**
  - Uses **Google Gemini API** for creative text generation and visual art.
  - Ensures the story flow and images align with a kid-friendly narrative.

- **Comic Compilation**
  - Automatically generates a **comic book** view from the story and images.
  - Each panel represents a chapter or event.

### 🔑 Usage
1. Open SideQuest and **start a new story** or select one from your **library**.  
2. Choose a starting prompt generated by AI — or write your own opening line.  
3. After each line you add, the **AI continues the story** and generates a **matching image**.  
4. Continue alternating turns with the AI until your story is complete.  
5. View the final result as a **comic book**, with one image per story segment.  
6. Revisit any past story and choose a scene to start a **SideQuest** — creating an alternate branch of your narrative.

### 📊 AI Story Generation

- **Model**: Google Gemini (Text + Image Generation)
- **Input Data:**
  - User story prompts or custom storylines  
  - Context from previous story nodes (for continuity)
- **Output:**
  - Next story paragraph written by AI  
  - Matching illustration generated by Gemini
  - Supports exporting stories as PDFs  

**Workflow:**
1. User submits a new line.  
2. Django backend calls **Gemini API** for story + image generation.  
3. The generated text and image are saved and displayed in React frontend.  
4. Completed stories are compiled into a visual comic format.

## 🚀 Future Improvements:

- Add user authentication and profiles (save stories by user)  
- Enable collaborative storytelling between multiple users  
- Improve scalability for branching story storage (graph-based DB)  
- Integrate background music and narration for immersive reading  
- Parental dashboard for monitoring and feedback  



🔑 **API Improvement**  
Experiment with additional models (OpenAI GPT, Stability AI, or Gemini Vision) to create more vivid illustrations and coherent story arcs.
